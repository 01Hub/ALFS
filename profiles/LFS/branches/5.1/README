==============================================
        LFS-5.1.1 PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.1.8 or later.

To allow an easier customization of the configuration files,
there is now a configuration directory for the different
configurations the profile could be used to generate.

To use the profile you should :-

1) If you downloaded the LFS packages seperately you should copy 
   the config_seperate directory to a directory named config :-

  	cp -r config_seperate config
	
or

   If you downloaded the lfs-package tarball you should copy the
   config_tarball directory to a directory named config :-

   	cp -r config_tarball config

   NOTE: The LFS-5.1.1 package tarball has restricted permissions
         on the package files contained in it. This will cause errors
         while executing this profile, because the "lfs" user used
         during chapter 5 will not be able to access the files. To
         correct this problem, after unpacking the package tarball,
         issue the following command in the lfs-packages directory:

            chmod go+r *

         This will add group and other read permissions to the files,
         making them accessible to the "lfs" user.
  
2) Customize the files in the new configuration directory
   - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
     (Note: this file contains an entity called TERM that should be
            set to the same value as the TERM environment variable on
            your build system. It defaults to "linux", the most common
            value for a GNU/Linux system.)
   - the file fstab.xml contains the commands to generate the fstab file
   - the file kernel.xml contains the commands for building the kernel
   - the file grub.xml contains the commands for configuring the grub 
     bootloader although the steps to do this are commented out by 
     default
   - the files keymap-ch6.xml and keymap-ch8.xml are used to set up
     the default keymap

3) This profile contains two additional packages that are installed
   during chapter 9, libxml2 and nALFS. This is done under the
   assumption that you will want to use nALFS once you have booted
   your new LFS system to continue building other packages (via BLFS
   or other profiles).

4) Execute sh ./runit as root. Please note that if you have installed 
   nALFS into a location other than /usr/local/bin you will need to edit
   runit to point to your copy of nALFS.
