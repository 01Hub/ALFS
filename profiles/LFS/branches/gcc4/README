==============================================
        LFS-SVN PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.2.3 or later.

This profile contains two areas that must be customized to create
your LFS installation:

- "config" directory
  This directory contains a variety of files used directly by the
  profile to build your system. They are:
   - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
     (Note: this file contains an entity called TERM that should be
            set to the same value as the TERM environment variable on
            your build system. It defaults to "linux", the most common
            value for a GNU/Linux system.)
   - the file kernel.xml contains the commands for building the kernel
   - the files keymap-ch6.xml and keymap-ch8.xml are used to set up
     the default keymap
   - file console.xml contains the commands to set up the Linux
     console for non-US English language support

- "skeleton" directory
  This directory (and all its subdirectories) contain all the standard
  text config files used by an LFS build. You should review every file
  in this directory to ensure that it contains the values that you wish
  to use to configure your system.

  Note: there is no documentation in this profile on the use and values
  of each of these files. If you are not familiar enough with these files
  to know what you should put into them, you are probably not yet ready to
  be performing automated LFS builds using this profile.

To use the profile you should :-

1) Make a backup copy of the config directory.

2) Customize the files in the config directory.

3) Make a copy of the skeleton directory and give it name that
   represents the system you are building for.

4) Customize the files in the new skeleton directory you created.

5) Place a valid Linux kernel config file (for the kernel version
   the profile uses) into the skeleton directory and name it
   "linux-kernel-config". This will be used in the chapter 8
   portion of the build to build and install the kernel.

6) This profile contains two additional packages that are installed
   during chapter 9, libxml2 and nALFS. This is done under the
   assumption that you will want to use nALFS once you have booted
   your new LFS system to continue building other packages (via BLFS
   or other profiles). These packages are optional.

7) Execute "./runit.sh {skeleton}" as root, providing the name of the
   directory you created in step 3. Please note that if you have installed
   nALFS into a location other than /usr/local/bin you will need to edit
   runit.sh to point to your copy of nALFS.
