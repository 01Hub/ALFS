<!--
     This file contains various entities that must be customized 
     for the build to work on your machine.

     For the build to be successfull, you should :
     - run nALFS as root
     - check that your umask is 022

     -->

<!-- Directory in which LFS system will be installed.
     The build process try to mkdir -p it if it doen't exist.
     If you want to build LFS in its own partition (which
     is normally the case), you should create the directory 
     and mount the  partition before running nALFS.
     -->
<!ENTITY LFS "/mnt/lfs">

<!-- Location of your LFS packages.
     This is the directory in which all the packages downloaded
     from ftp.linuxfromscratch.org (or their original servers)
     are before running the script. The content of this directory
     will be copied in a subdirectory of &LFS; at the beginning of
     the build.
     IMPORTANT : be carefull about the original packages dir; if you 
                 enter the wrong directory, nALFS will try to download
                 all the packages in it !!!
