                     BLFS-6.0 Profile
===========================================================

Note: We recommend that you read this README completely
before you start using the profile.

Downloading the packages:
=========================

The BLFS profile ships with a list of URL's of the packages
in the BLFS book. These lists can be found in ./wget/
We also provide a script that takes care of downloading the
packages using wget. This script is ./wget.blfs

The wget.blfs script uses the following syntax:
 sh ./wget.blfs <destination_dir> <wget_list>

Make sure to download all needed packages before you start,
or else your build will fail. Also make sure you set the
correct path to the packages you have downloaded in
./config/config.ent

Problematic packages:
=====================

For various reasons some packages can't be automatically
downloaded and have to be downloaded manually.

This is a list of those packages:

 - The Sun Java SDK (Binary and Source)
