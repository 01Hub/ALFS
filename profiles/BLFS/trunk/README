                     BLFS-svn Profile
===========================================================

Note: We recommend that you read this README completely
before you start using the profile.

This profile contains the instructions to automatically
build the packages of the BLFS book. It is expected to be
used on an LFS system.

Configuring the profile:
========================

There are some configuration files that must be customized
before you can create your BLFS installation. These are:

 - !to be added once we've figured out about config/general.ent!

 - all files in ./config_standard/{etc,home,root,x} and
   subdirectories. Things you need to configure are marked
   with exclamation marks, !like this!.

Running the profile:
====================

To use the profile you should:

 1) Download the packages you need. See ./README.download
    for more details.

 2) First copy the config_standard directory to [name of your choice]
    Then create a link called config to the directory you chose above.
    Ex. ln -s ./config_standard ./config

 3) Customize the files in the config directory.

 4) Execute ./runit.sh as root. This will create a file
    "files.ent" (which contains an entity declaration that
    allows us to have absolute paths in the profile) and
    then run nALFS to start the build.
