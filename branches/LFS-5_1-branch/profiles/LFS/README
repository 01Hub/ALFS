==============================================
        LFS-CVS PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.1.8 or later.

To allow an easier customization of the configuration files,
there is now a configuration directory for the different
configurations the profile could be used to generate.

To use the profile you should :-

1) if you downloaded the LFS packages seperately you should copy 
   the config_seperate directory to a directory named config :-

  	cp -r config_seperate config
	
or

   if you downloaded the lfs-package tarball (only applies to LFS-5.0)
   you should copy the config_tarball directory to a directory named
   config :-

   	cp -r config_tarball config
  
2) customize the files in the new configuration directory
   - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
   - the file fstab.xml contains the command to generate the fstab file
   - the file kernel.xml contains the profile for building the kernel
   - the file grub.xml contains the commands for configuring the grub 
     bootloader although the steps to do this are commented out by 
     default
   - the file keymap.xml is used to set up the default keymap

3) execute sh ./runit as root. Please note that if you have installed 
   nALFS into a location other than /usr/local/bin you will need to edit
   runit to point to your copy of nALFS.
