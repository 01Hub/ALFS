List of items that should be done:
==================================


o  Do something about curl inside chroot.  Also try libxml2's nano*
   functions.

o  Allow changing more options from the program.

o  Chrooting and using ALLOW_RELATIVE_DIRS usually doesn't work.
   Try fixing it.

o  Command for checking <unpack> elements of package under the cursor.
   After 'P', where other package-related commands can be added as well
   latter ('d' for displaying description for example).

o  Profile: <description>, <digest>, common configure options
   (for optimization and stuff).

o  Use "logfile" from <package> if it is specified.

o  Add logging for <stage>, consider renaming packages/ and maybe
   remove "Entering stage:".

o  If fetching file from <reference> fails, we should check for another
   one.  Start using original package locations in the profile, when
   this is implemented.

o  Add <packageinfo> with all elements <stageinfo> has, plus
   <description>.

o  Add option for different .files outputs.

o  Add umask support to <stage>.

o  Allow using md5sum if ssl library is not found.

o  Allow compiling the handlers in (--static-plugins, or something).

o  Saving the profile back to a file.

o  Displaying XML (as in the profile) of elements under the cursor in
   the main window (for easier checking of specific profile's part).
   Have to wait for the above (when element_t -> xmlNode is implemented).

o  Adding/removing elements.  New command for choosing them from the list
   of known elements (without the need to do much manual profile writing).

o  Editing of entities.

o  Hiding of "parameter elements" and adding them to element info.

o  Command for showing (marking them somehow) elements that will run,
   installed packages, not installed packages etc. (in the profile).

o  Printing the list of all installed packages (and their files,
   compile times, etc.).

o  Clean or rewrite the logging of files.  Check out install-log
   (http://install-log.sourceforge.net/) and what it can do,
   that we can't.

o  Logging of installed package sizes.

o  Add small browser for adding new profiles.

o  Improve <search_replace> to allow working with multiple lines.

o  Use libxml2's _SAX_ parsing.

o  Print libxml2's error output on _one_ line.

o  Play with compressing large files, when sending them over the sockets
   (like list of files).

o  Make timer, profile name and option indicators' positions configurable.

o  Add package time to timer.

o  Pause the timer while collecting files.

o  Add some progress indicator when downloading files.

o  Consider allowing something like <!ENTITY path "$PATH"> and
   the best way to do that.  Or not.

o  New command for redirecting the output to the system command being
   executed.  For allowing "make config" for example.

o  Play with libxstl.


o  Rewrite/improve apc, or add a command-line option in nALFS
   (loading the profile afterward).

o  Update flog so it can convert between different .files outputs
   (simplifying the current, for example). Watch for -> in sym links.

o  Update the documentation - logging files/times, external programs
   needed in some cases, timer, configuration file etc.


Discussion needed:
------------------

o  Give <undo> more thinking.

o  $HOME/.nALFS/ doesn't make any sense.  This should be a single, global,
   system-wide directory.  Like /var/log/ALFS, or something.  Format of
   the files needs standardizing too.

o  Play with dependency info inside <package> - format and all the things
   needed (name of the required package, min/max version etc.).
   Implement <requires> and <utilizes>, and maybe add some commands for
   working with them.

o  Check out LSB's changes.  "nofail" attribute for example - something
   similar was already suggested on alfs-discuss, but was forgotten.
   Same with <cond>.
