ALFS communications protocol
****************************

Initial handshake:

1) Client binds to a free local port.
2) Client generates a 128 byte random secret.
3) Client runs 'alfsd $locahost $listenport $secret' via ssh on the machine
	the daemon should run on.
4) Client initializes an SSL connection.
5) Daemon connects to the client via SSL and sends the random secret back.
6) If the secret matches the one generated on the client the initialisation
	was succesful.

Communication:

[TODO]

End of communication:
	
1) comm_deinit() is called on the client.
2) Client waits until he receives a single MANGO (as defined in libcomm.h)
	from the daemon.
3) comm_srv_deinit() sends the MANGO and the client shuts down.
