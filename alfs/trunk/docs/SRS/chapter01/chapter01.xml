<title>Scope</title>
<para>This document covers the high level descriptions of all the functionality
that the <quote>alfs</quote> tool will provide.  The scope of this document will
be limited to describing what features will be made available, and therefore
will not go into detail on any specific programming languages or development
tools.</para>

<title>Product Name</title>
  <para>The tool is called <quote>alfs</quote>.  It is important it be written
entirely in lowercase to differentiate it from the project name it is a part of
(ALFS).</para>

  <para>The project is the tool and the tool is the project, so the name should
  fit inside this idea and is why the name <quote>alfs</quote> was chosen.

<title>Overview</title>
<para><quote>alfs</quote> is a tool that is used to simplify and automate the tasks that
installing and managing software packages on a Linux system require. Its primary
goal is to automate the LFS build procedure. Using a standard documented
protocol, <quote>alfs</quote> will accept instructions, validate them, and
carry out the specific tasks that correspond to these higher-level orders.
<quote>alfs</quote> will then report back on the outcomes of its actions.</para>
