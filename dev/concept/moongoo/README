* Dependencies:

libcurl 	http://curl.haxx.se/
libtar 		http://www.feep.net/libtar/
libxml2 	http://www.xmlsoft.org/
openssl		http://www.openssl.org/

libtar can be installed by cmmi, all others are in BLFS.

* Notes

The libtar-based code does not work on x86_64 atm, because of a design issue
in the library which requires int and void* to be of the same size.
