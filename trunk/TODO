    o document the syntax in a user friendly way. (XML Docbook)

    o write down all the suggestions for syntax improves that have been
      talked about by "The Committe" (aka alfs-discuss ;)
	- This will entail literally reading all of alfs-discuss over the
	  past 3-4 months now, iirc.

    o list other alfs-like implementations with description on the website
	-n ALFS (allready listed)
	- Mark Ellis alfs (allready listed)
	- LFSMake
	- ralfs
	- sourcer
	- Will have to consult my bookmarks for more..

    o Look into ANT (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant) some more.
	- Suggestion on the mail about dependencies and the option of
	  force, ignoring an error.

    o More to be added soon...
