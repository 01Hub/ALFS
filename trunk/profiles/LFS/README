        LFS-CVS PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.1.8 or later.

To allow an easier customization of the configuration files,
there is now a configuration directory for the different
configurations the profile could be used to generate.

To use the profile you should:

- create a configuration directory by copying the config_sample directory;
  should be named config_XXX where XXX is the name of the configuration

- customize the files in the new configuration directory
  - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
  - the file fstab.xml contains the command to generate the fstab file
  - the file kernel.xml contains the profile for building the kernel
  - the file grub.xml contains the commands for configuring grub - 
      these are commented out by default

- create a symbolic link named "config" to the configuration
  you want to use

- if you downloaded the lfs-packages-5.0 tarball from the lfs website
  then one change needs to be made to LFS-5.0.xml:
	The line <!ENTITY % package_entities SYSTEM "package.ent">
	needs to be changed to read
	<!ENTITY % package_entities SYSTEM "package-5.0tb.ent">

- execute sh ./runit as root. Please note that if you have installed nALFS
  into a non-standard location (/usr/local/bin) then you may need to edit
  runit to point to your local copy.
