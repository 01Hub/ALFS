     - run nALFS as root
     - check that your umask is 022

     The build process try to mkdir -p it if it doen't exist.
     If you want to build LFS in its own partition (which
     is normally the case), you should create the directory 
     and mount the  partition before running nALFS.

     This is the directory in which all the packages downloaded

     are before running the script. The content of this directory
     will be copied in a subdirectory of &LFS; at the beginning of
     the build.
     IMPORTANT : be carefull about the original packages dir; if you 
                 enter the wrong directory, nALFS will try to download
                 all the packages in it !!!
