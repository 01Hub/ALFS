<!--The console script uses the /etc/sysconfig/console as a configuration file. You need to decide which keymap
and screen font you will use. The language-specific HOWTO can help you. In the future releases of
LFS-Bootscripts, there will be a pre-made /etc/sysconfig/console file with known good settings for several
countries, and you will just have to uncomment the relevant section. If still in doubt, look into /usr/share/kbd
for valid keymaps and screen fonts. Then read the loadkeys and setfont manual pages and figure out the correct
arguments for these programs. Once you decided, create the configuration file with the following command -->

<!-- In some keymaps, the Backspace and Delete keys send characters different form ones in the default keymap
built into the kernel. This confuses some applications, e.g. Emacs displays its help (instead of erasing the
character before the cursor) when you press Backspace. To check if your keymap is affected (this works only for
i386 keymaps) -->
