        BELFS PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.1.8 or later.

To allow an easier customization of the configuration files,
there is now a configuration directory for the different
configurations the profile could be used to generate.

To use the profile you should :-

1) copy the config_separate directory to a new config directory with
   whatever name you like, then create a symlink called "config" to that
   directory

  	cp -r config_separate config.my.system
        ln -s config.my.system config
	
2) customize the files in the new configuration directory
   - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
   - the file fstab.xml contains the command to generate the fstab file
   - the file kernel.xml contains the profile for building the kernel
   - the file grub.xml contains the commands for configuring the grub 
     bootloader although the steps to do this are commented out by 
     default
   - the file keymap.xml is used to set up the default keymap

3) execute sh ./runit as root. Please note that if you have installed 
   nALFS into a location other than /usr/local/bin you will need to edit
   runit to point to your copy of nALFS.
