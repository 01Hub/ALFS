     The build process try to mkdir -p it if it doen't exist.
     If you want to build BELFS in its own partition (which
     is normally the case), you should create the directory 
     and mount the  partition before running nALFS.

     the build.
     IMPORTANT : be carefull about the original packages dir; if you 
                 enter the wrong directory, nALFS will try to download
