<title>Conventions Used In This Book</title>

<para>To make things easy to follow, there are a number of conventions used
throughout the book.  Following are some examples:</para>

<screen><command>./configure --prefix=/usr</command></screen>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is designed to be typed in exactly as seen
unless otherwise noted in the surrounding text.</para></blockquote>

<para><filename>install-info: unknown option
'--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'</filename></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text (fixed width text) is showing screen
output, probably as the result of commands issued and is also used to show
filenames such as <filename>/bin/grep</filename></para></blockquote>

<para><emphasis>Emphasis</emphasis></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for several purposes in the
book but mainly to emphasize important points or to give examples as to
what to type.</para></blockquote>

<para><ulink url="&alfs-root;">&alfs-root;</ulink></para>

<blockquote><para>This form of text is used for hyperlinks, both within the
book and to external pages such as HowTo's, download locations,
websites, etc.</para></blockquote>

<screen><userinput><command>cat &gt; $LFS/etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"</command>>
	root:x:0:
	bin:x:1:
	......
<command>EOF</command></userinput></screen>

<blockquote><para>This type of section is used mainly when creating
configuration files.  The first command (in bold) tells the system to create
the file <filename>$LFS/etc/group</filename> from whatever is typed on the
following lines until the sequence <acronym>EOF</acronym> is encountered.
Therefore, this whole section is generally typed as seen.</para></blockquote>
