README for the ALFS syntax_doc module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* DocBook XML DTD-4.2

* DocBook XSL Stylesheets-1.65.1 or better

* libxml2-2.6.8 or better

* libxslt-1.1.5 or better

* lynx-2.8.4 or better


2. Setting up the DTD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps in the BLFS book for all the packages.  It is pretty
simple.

*** Note that the directory that the HTML files are output to
can be altered by changing the OUTDIR variable at the top of the Makefile,
ensuring that when you do so, you're new value has a trailing "/".  Also
note that the directory that DocBook XSL is installed in can be altered by
changing the XSLROOTDIR variable at the top of the Makefile.  This one is
important as a sed later on won't work if you have this set wrong. ***


3. Processing the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By far the easiest way to process the source is by running 
`make chunks-html`.  An explanation of the process follows:

For the chunked HTML output, we run the top-level index.xml file through
xsltproc in conjunction with the alfs-chunked.xsl stylesheet.  The
index.xml file just has a bunch of entity instructions in it, which
pulls in all the different chapters of the book.  The alfs-chunked
stylesheet (in stylesheets/) is a customisation layer, on top of the
docbook-xsl XHTML/chunked.xsl stylesheet.  It basically configures some
layout related variables to tweak the output to the liking of the ALFS
readership.  The majority of work is delegated to the docbook-xsl
stylesheets.  HTML visual representation is provided by alfs.css also in
the stylesheets/ directory.

For the non-chunked HTML output, we do a lot of the same processing like
the chunked version, except we use alfs-nochunks.xsl which like
alfs-chunked.xsl is a customisation layer to onechunk.xsl provided by
docbook-xsl.  The commnad for this one is `make nochunks-html`.

For the flat text output, we run the nochunks-html target first and then
pass the result through lynx.
