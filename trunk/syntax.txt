Proposed "official" syntax for ALFS:
====================================

This will have todo untill better docs can be written.

In the mean time, we can at least build up a reference
of the current plans for the syntax.


Generic Tags:
-------------

unpack
configure
make
execute
remove
copy
move
link
mkdir
permissions
setenv


Generic Package:
----------------

<package>
    <info>
        <name>[package name]</name>
        <version>[package version]</version>
    </info>

    ...

</package>

I've presently left out the prebuild/build/postbuild (setup/build/install)
untill we pick the best way to deal this this.  Allthough it would problably
be best to leave the use of them optional anyways. (ala target problably)

Generic Profile:
----------------

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>

<alfs>

    ... use of generic tags and packages ...

</alfs>

Entities are totally optional.  However they can be quite usefull.
