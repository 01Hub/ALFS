<para>Being a Systems Engineer by trade and having used Linux From Scratch
(<acronym>LFS</acronym>) for about a year, I was looking for a way to automate
tasks on my Linux servers at work. One day, while surfing the
<acronym>LFS</acronym> website, I found the <acronym>ALFS</acronym> project
and then the nALFS implementation. After trying it out, I fell in love with
the tool. I have been able to completely automate server builds, software
package installation and administrative tasks across my data center. Since I
like the product so much, I wanted to give back to the project and decided to
take on the task of documentation. I hope you like the product as much as I do
and it provides the same utility to your environment as it has mine.</para>
