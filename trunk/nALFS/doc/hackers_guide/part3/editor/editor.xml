<sect1>

<para>Editing the guides for the &book-product; is not difficult at any
stretch of the imagination. The biggest piece is have an understanding of
the DocBook XML DTD. The DTD's <ulink url="http://docbook.org/">home
page</ulink> has a lot of information on how to use it and <ulink
url="http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html">a book</ulink> is also
available.</para>

<para>The books (or guides) each have their own unique design and layout.
They all, however, share a lot of common pieces. As mentioned above, they
are all written using the DocBook XML DTD v4.3. They all can be parsed into
three formats: chunks-html, nochunks-html and flat-text.</para>
