<title>Distribution Tarballs</title>

<para>When you are ready to produce a tarball for distribution, there are a
few steps to follow:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Check out a clean copy of the nALFS repository. Using an
existing copy, especially one that has been configured and used as a build
tree, can potentially cause errors in the <command>make dist</command> process.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Edit <filename>bootstrap.configure</filename>, and modify the line
starting with AC_INIT to reflect the version number
that you want the distribution to be given (replace &quot;CVS&quot; with your desired version number). Do not commit this change to the CVS
repository, as the CVS version should always report its version number as
&quot;CVS&quot;.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Run <command>sh ./bootstrap --get-docs</command>. This command
will create the configure script and Makefile (as is normally done with a CVS
checkout), but will also download, extract and rename the documentation files
that will be included in the tarball. These files include the DTD (the current
CVS version), the syntax document describing the DTD, the user's guide and
the hacker's guide. The latter three documents are currently downloaded from
James Robertson's home directory on the LFS server, but see the URL_BASE
variable in the bootstrap script to change the download source.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Run <command>./configure</command> specifying any
parameters your system needs to complete the configuration process.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Run <command>make dist</command>. This will produce both a
<filename>.tar.gz</filename> and a <filename>.tar.bz2</filename> file in the
current directory containing everything that should be needed to build
<acronym>&book-product;</acronym> on an end-user's system. Note that this
tarball will be created using the <filename>autoconf</filename>,
<filename>automake</filename> and <filename>libtool</filename> versions
<emphasis>on your development system</emphasis>, so please make sure they are
current releases before creating a tarball for public
consumption.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Run <command>make distcheck</command>. If your system requires
any special parameters to be given to configure for it to complete (like
<command>--with-libxml2</command>, for example), then you can use
<command>make DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS=&quot;...&quot; distcheck</command> to supply
those parameters. The distcheck process will actually unpack the tarball into
a temporary directory, and run a complete configure/make/install/uninstall
process on it to ensure that no build errors occur. This step should be
considered to be mandatory before releasing your tarball to the general
public.</para></listitem>
