README for the ALFS syntax_doc module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a quick readme file on setting up the tools necessary to parse the
nALFS Hackers Guide XML source into other formats (e.g. HTML or TXT).  If
you do not want to do that, then you do not need to read this file.  The
XML source is generally available for viewing and download on the LFS
website at http://linuxfromscratch.org/alfs.

1. Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* libxml2-2.6.10 or better
	-- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/libxml2.html

* libxslt-1.1.6 or better
	-- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/general/libxslt.html

* DocBook XML DTD-4.3
	-- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/xml.html

* DocBook XSL Stylesheets-1.65.1 or better 
	-- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/pst/docbook-xsl.html

* lynx-2.8.5 or better
	-- http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/cvs/basicnet/lynx.html

2. Setting up the DTD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps in the BLFS book for all the packages listed above in the
requirements section.  It is pretty simple.  The biggest thing is making
sure that your /etc/xml/catalog and /etc/xml/docbook files are setup
correctly.

*** Note that the directory that the HTML files are output to
can be altered by changing the OUTDIR variable at the top of the Makefile
or by passing a new variable via the command line, ensuring that when you
do so, you're new value has a trailing "/".  Also note that the directory
that DocBook XSL is installed in can be altered by changing the XSLROOTDIR
variable at the top of the Makefile.  This one is important as a sed later
on won't work if you have this set wrong. ***

3. Processing the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By far the easiest way to process the source is by running 
`make chunks-html`.  An explanation of the process follows:

For the chunked HTML output, we run the top-level index.xml file through
xsltproc in conjunction with the alfs-chunked.xsl stylesheet.  The
index.xml file just has a bunch of entity instructions in it, which
pulls in all the different chapters of the book.  The alfs-chunked
stylesheet (in stylesheets/) is a customisation layer, on top of the
docbook-xsl XHTML/chunked.xsl stylesheet.  It basically configures some
layout related variables to tweak the output to the liking of the ALFS
readership.  The majority of work is delegated to the docbook-xsl
stylesheets.  HTML visual representation is provided by alfs.css also in
the stylesheets/ directory.

For the non-chunked HTML output, run `make nochunks-html`.  We do a lot of
the same processing like the chunked version, except we use
alfs-nochunks.xsl which like alfs-chunked.xsl is a customisation layer to
onechunk.xsl provided by docbook-xsl.  The commnad for this one is `make
nochunks-html`.

For the flat text output, run `make flat-text`.  We run the nochunks-html
target first and then pass the result through lynx.
