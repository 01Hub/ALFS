    Sending a log file _before_ a list of changed files to the frontend.
    merge_log_files() now reads a list of changed files itself and creates
    a unique file to store it. That file name is added to package log.

 o  2002 Mar 19 20:13:22 +01:00
    read_to_file() accepts file name now, not open fp.
    receive_state_or_files_file() split.

 o  2002 Mar 18 11:26:12 +01:00
    All macros (function-like) renamed to Xxxxx (they look better,
    and are still distinguishable from regular functions).
    Some prototype fixes.

 o  2002 Mar 17 13:49:54 +01:00
    Debug_logging() macro added.
    create_xml_doc() was called only once, but freed every time
    the package ends. Fixed that.
    (The function is only used in logging.c now.)

 o  2002 Mar 17 11:50:22 +01:00
    Frontend doesn't chdir() to nalfs_directory any more. Instead absolute
    paths are used everywhere (it's much cleaner and also fixes reloading
    of relative profiles).
    status.log renamed to log_file.

 o  2002 Mar 17 11:22:47 +01:00
    Displaying comments by default turned off.

 o  2002 Mar 17 00:12:05 +01:00
    _A_lot_ of improvements/code cleaning in logging functions.
    Two log files are now created - one is the main log file for
    the package (XML, using libXML) and the other is a list of
    installed/changed files. Logging of times much simplified too.

    (xstrcasestr() added).
