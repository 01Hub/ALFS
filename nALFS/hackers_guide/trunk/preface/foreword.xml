<para>Being a Systems Engineer by trade and having used Linux From Scratch
(LFS) for about a year, I was looking for a way to automate tasks on my
Linux servers at work. One day, while surfing the LFS website, I found the
ALFS project and then the nALFS implementation. After trying it out, I fell
in love with the tool. I have been able to completely automate server
builds, software package installation and administrative tasks across my
data center. Since I like the product so much, I wanted to give back to the
project and decided to take on the task of documentation. I hope you like
the product as much as I do and it provides the same utility to your
environment as it has mine.</para>
