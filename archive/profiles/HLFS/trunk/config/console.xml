    <!--
      The console script uses the /etc/sysconfig/console as a configuration file. You need to decide which keymap
      and screen font you will use. The language-specific HOWTO can help you. In the future releases of
      LFS-Bootscripts, there will be a pre-made /etc/sysconfig/console file with known good settings for several
      countries, and you will just have to uncomment the relevant section. If still in doubt, look into /usr/share/kbd
      for valid keymaps and screen fonts. Then read the loadkeys and setfont manual pages and figure out the correct
      arguments for these programs. Once you decided, create the configuration file with the following commands

    <mkdir>
      <option>parents</option>
      <name>/etc/sysconfig</name>

    <!--
      In some keymaps, the Backspace and Delete keys send characters different from ones in the default keymap
      built into the kernel. This confuses some applications, e.g. Emacs displays its help (instead of erasing the
      character before the cursor) when you press Backspace. To check if your keymap is affected (this works only for
      i386 keymaps)
