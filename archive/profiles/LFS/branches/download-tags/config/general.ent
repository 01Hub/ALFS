     This file contains various entities that must be customized 
     for the build to work on your machine.

     For the build to be successfull, you should :
     - run nALFS as root
     - check that your umask is 022

     -->

<!-- Directory in which LFS system will be installed.
     The build process try to mkdir -p it if it doen't exist.
     If you want to build LFS in its own partition (which
     is normally the case), you should create the directory 
     and mount the  partition before running nALFS.

     will be copied in a subdirectory of &LFS; at the beginning of
     the build.
     IMPORTANT : be carefull about the original packages dir; if you 
                 enter the wrong directory, nALFS will try to download
                 all the packages in it !!!
