        LFS-6.0-CD PROFILE
==============================================

This profile must be used with nALFS 1.2.3 or later.

This profile is distributed on the LFS-6.0 CD (included with the
LFS-6.0 printed book, and available for download via the LFS website),
and is preconfigured for use in that CD's running environment.

To use the profile you should :-

1) Produce a kernel .config file. The easiest way to do this is to
   unpack the linux source to a mounted hard drive partition, run
   'make mrproper' inside the newly created linux-(version) directory,
   and run 'make menuconfig'. Choose the options corresponding to
   your hardware and finally save your configuration as:
   /etc/linux-config
   
2) Customize the files in the 'config' directory
   - the file general.ent contains a bunch of entity declarations
     (Note: this file contains an entity called TERM that should be
            set to the same value as the TERM environment variable on
            your build system. It defaults to "linux", the most common
            value for a GNU/Linux system.)
   - the file fstab.xml contains the commands to generate the fstab file
   - the file kernel.xml contains the commands for building the kernel
   - the file grub.xml contains the commands for configuring the grub 
     bootloader although the steps to do this are commented out by 
     default
   - the files keymap-ch6.xml and keymap-ch8.xml are used to set up
     the default keymap
   - the file console.xml is for setting up the default keymap with
     support for i18n.	

3) This profile contains two additional packages that are installed
   during chapter 9, libxml2 and nALFS. This is done under the
   assumption that you will want to use nALFS once you have booted
   your new LFS system to continue building other packages (via BLFS
   or other profiles).

4) Execute sh ./runit as root.
