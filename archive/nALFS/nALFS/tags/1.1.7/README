nALFS, version 1.1.7
====================


nALFS is used for parsing the ALFS profiles (simple XML files) and, 
following those profiles, do various things (like executing commands), 
one by one, to (usually) compile some packages.

1. LFS, ALFS
============

LFS stands for Linux From Scratch and it's a project, led by Gerard
Beekmans <gerard@linuxfromscratch.org>, which helps you build your own
Linux system.

What this means is that you will be using nothing but the source code
of various packages needed for fully functional Linux system. You will
compile them, one be one, on your own machine, and therefore, they
will be maximally optimized for it. Also, you will be able to tweak
every single corner of your system, by editing bunch of configuration
files, creating your own boot scripts etc.

All this might sound a bit complicated, requiring too much work. But
even if it is, it's well worth it.

However, it doesn't have to be that complicated. With only a few
keystrokes and the right software, you can just sit back and relax,
while your system is being built. This is where ALFS comes into play.

ALFS stands for Automated Linux From Scratch, and its aim is to
provide a much simpler method for building a Linux system.

ALFS uses the profiles, simple XML files, which describe what actions
are to be taken and what commands executed. Feeding the program (like
nALFS) with those profiles, will make the program act upon them.

For example, if you want to create a directory, all you have to do is
to put:

    <mkdir>
        <name>/some/directory</name>
    </mkdir>

in the profile and leave the rest to the program. Of course, you are
not limited to just compiling packages for LFS. You can do just about
anything.

This might seem very similar to ordinary shell scripting, but it has
also a lot of advantages. With this approach, nALFS, which reads the
given profile, can be instructed to pause execution, start execution
from selected element (by browsing a profile in a tree-like mode) and
much much more.

development of ALFS) can also be found at the above site.


2. Quick start
==============

To configure, compile, install and run nALFS, just type:

    ./configure
    make
    make install
    nALFS profiles/LFS/latest.xml

When you enter the program, type '?' for a list of all available
commands.


3. Requirements
===============

For actual parsing of XML profiles, nALFS uses libxml2 (a.k.a. gnome-xml)
library. You can find it on its homepage, http://xmlsoft.org/.


4. Compiling and installing
===========================

First, you have to configure the package by typing:

    ./configure

To see the list of all available options, use "./configure --help".

By default, nALFS executable will be stored in /usr/local/bin, while
handlers will be copied to /usr/local/lib/nALFS directory.

You can change these defaults by specifying --prefix or --libdir
options to configure.

Then, type:

    make

to compile the program. To install it, use:

    make install


5. Running and usage
====================

Just type:

    nALFS profiles/LFS/latest.xml

where "profiles/LFS/latest.xml" is your favorite profile. Multiple
profiles separated with spaces can also be specified.

nALFS reads ~/.nALFSrc file, in which different options can be set.
An example of this file is located in doc/ directory.

When you enter the program, you can press '?' to display a list of all
available commands. They might be described here in detail one day -
for now, just a few random hints...


5.1 Run-status marks
--------------------

    >  - Currently running element
         (all parents of the running element are also marked like this).
    @  - Some, but not all, child elements are successfully done. 
    #  - Element, and all its child elements (if any) are successfully done.
    !  - Element, or at least one of its child elements (if any) failed.

You can change these manually by pressing 'm' and picking the right one.


5.2 Starting the execution
--------------------------

After pressing 's', you will have to choose what elements you want to
run. You have four options:

    m  - Run only marked elements. You can mark elements by pressing
         'Insert' or '*'. It doesn't matter whether they are already
         successfully executed or not - all marked elements will run
         again.

    c  - Run only the current element and its children. Elements marked
         with '#' will be skipped.

    n  - Run current element, its children, and all the elements below
         the current (on the same level/depth). Elements marked with
         '#' will be skipped.

    f  - Force running of current element and its children. Elements
         marked with '#' will also be executed.

Since the elements that have already successfully run won't run again
(unless they are marked or forced), you can safely press 's' on the
first element (your profile) without worrying that some elements will
get executed twice.

Elements that previously failed (marked with '!') will always run again.


5.3 Types of messages (in status window)
----------------------------------------

    I  - Informative message.
    H  - Help message.
    -  - System command output.
    W  - Warning.
    E  - Error message.

Marks that are not in color (if you see any color at all) are the ones
from the backend - a separate process that does all the work.


5.4 Options indicators
----------------------

All options are changeable with 'o' (quickly) and 'O' (after entering the
options' menu).

--| r a c v s o w h f B |--

    | | | | | | | | | |
    | | | | | | | | | |Log backend (times/handler actions/changed files).
    | | | | | | | | |
    | | | | | | | | |Log changed files (can be 'f' for logging using time
    | | | | | | | | |stamps, 'F' for logging using two finds, or empty).
    | | | | | | | | 
    | | | | | | | |Log handler actions.
    | | | | | | |
    | | | | | | |Log status window content.
    | | | | | |
    | | | | | |Follow running elements.
    | | | | |
    | | | | |Print system command output (see "Types of messages").
    | | | |
    | | | |Be verbose.
    | | |
    | | |Display comments.
    | |
    | |Display <alfs> element.
    |
    |Element to which you will jump after using 'J', 'K' or ';' commands.
    |It can be 'r' (for currently running), 'f' (for the one that failed),
    |'d' (for successfully done) or 'p' (for package).


5.5 Searching the profile
-------------------------

By pressing '/', you will be prompted to enter a search string.
Depending on your input (listed below), the search can be performed on
various parts of the profile:

   <string>     - everything
   ~e <string>  - names of the elements
   ~a <string>  - attributes (both name and value parts)
   ~c <string>  - contents
   ~p <string>  - names of the packages
   ~P <string>  - names of the packages (the exact match)

The last two can be especially useful, if you're trying to locate a
specific package in some large profile.

Searches are not case sensitive.


5.6 Non-interactive mode
------------------------

Using a command-line option -i (or --interactive) will toggle the mode
in which nALFS will run. By default (defined in config.h), nALFS runs
in the interactive mode.

However, it can also run in a non-interactive mode. By doing so, the
program will start executing the profiles immediately, without any
previous user interaction. All output will be printed on stdout. If
the execution fails for some reason, nALFS will simply exit with the
return value not equal to 0.

This mode can be useful, for example, if you're writing your own
scripts for automated installation and want to support ALFS profiles.
You could split the profile into smaller chunks and feed them, one by
one, to nALFS. By checking the program's return value, you could act
accordingly.


If you have any problems, either when compiling, running, or using the
program, do email me. Any suggestions, ideas, bug reports, patches etc.
are also highly welcome and can be sent to the address below.
