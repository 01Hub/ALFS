<title>Who Would Want To Read This Book</title>

<para>If you are planning on writing code, updating profiles or the
documentation for the nALFS implementation of the ALFS DTD, then this book
is for you. If this is not what you want to do, then this book is not for
you.  If all you want to do is to understand how to use nALFS, then please
direct your attention to the <filename>README</filename> file in the root
of the source tarball or the Users Guide in the <filename>doc</filename>
directory. </para>
